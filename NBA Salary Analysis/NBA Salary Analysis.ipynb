    "\n",
    "The National Basketball Association (NBA), comprised of thirty professional basketball teams in the United States and Canada, is one of the most influential athletic leagues in North America. As of 2018, the NBA is the fifth largest sports league in the world with a total revenue of about \\\\$8 billion. Some of this tremendous value is distributed to NBA players in the form of\n",
    "inordinately large salaries. Most teams have annual payrolls of over \\\\$100 million, so it is crucial for teams to ensure that players are worth the price of their contracts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect salaries to be driven by two main factors: on-court performance and \"social power.\" We expect that players who help their teams win more games and contend for championship titles should be paid well. Therefore, on-court performance data should be able to capture a large portion of the variation in player salaries.The second factor, \"social power,\" is a player’s ability to increase team revenues in the form of increased ticket and merchandise sales. We hypothesize that players with large social media followings and wide cultural influence will earn larger salaries regardless of their team’s performance."

This led the regression model to predict a salary of \\\\$10.22M, while he earned only \\\\$2.1M in the 2016-2017 season. After the season, Gobert signed a 4-year contract with the Utah Jazz for \\\\$25.5M per year. Gobert represents overperforming young players still in their rookie contracts.\n",

The model performs well, but the outlier analysis demonstrates some of the potential issues that could be worked out in the future. Specifically, we might consider including a dummy variable to indicate whether a player has a Twitter account, as well as taking the league minimum salary into consideration. \n",
