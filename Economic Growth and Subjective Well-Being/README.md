To follow along with the analysis procedure, begin by running R Code.R in R using Final_Data.xlsx. 
This uses backward stepwise variable selection to create sub_data.csv, a subset of the initial variables from Final_Data.xlsx. 
Then use the SAS Code.txt in SAS with sub_data.csv to complete the analysis.
